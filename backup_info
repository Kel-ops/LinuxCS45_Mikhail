Write a program to read input from a user
   1. Display a menu to ask the user for their name
   2. Use a function call to call the 'menu' function from a file called 'myfunctions'
        --ask ...what directories do you want to back up?
              ...Do you want to comprees your data?
   3. After you get the users name, ask them if they want to backup their home directory"
   4. $HOME/.secret/.backup   --> mkdir -p $HOME/.secret/.backup
      BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/.secret/.backup"
      Change permissions of BACKUP_DIR to 700   # chmod 700 $BACKUP_DIR

   5. Your script will copy regular files from $HOME/homework BACKUP_DIR 
   6. Ask your users if they want to compress their files...Check to see that it's a 
      file. If it's a file, then compress before you do your backup. Or,....think of
      another way to save space.
