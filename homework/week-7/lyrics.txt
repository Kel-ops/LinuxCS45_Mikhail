Ballin' since I was jit
Way before Oakland filmin' the skits, I had a goal to get rich
Momma was strugglin' paying the rent
I couldn't help her with shit
Hate that I'm feelin' so stuck in this bitch (Devo this shit hard)
Car broke down, can't fix that shit
I cried at night, I'll admit that shit
O2, old, I'll whip that bitch
She left me 'lone but I miss that bitch
If she text right now, I'll hit that bitch
Old friends like "How you get that lit?"
Same old me but they think I switched
Fuck old friends, I don't know that bitch
Racks too big, can't fold that shit
I ain't get none when I owned that shit
Momma I told you we gon' be okay
Whippin' that Benz and she live in L.A
Tryna thank God but don't know what to say
